# General

Mule is a round-robin database tool (RRDtool) that can be used for applicative monitoring. Mule allows you to easily define families of metrics and to input data through a simple command line. Data can be retrieved from the Mule server using HTTP GET requests. Mule stores data according to user-defined retention settings, known as a *retention pair*.

It has the following features:

* You do not need to define metrics in advance, you can add new metrics at any time by using simple patterns.
* Mule can store multiple data sequences using different retention settings for the same metric.
* Metrics have a hierarchical name structure. Mule aggregates data from the child nodes into the parent node. When you analyze the data, you can drill-down from the parent node to view more specific data in the child nodes.
* Thresholds can be defined (similar to [Nagios](http://www.nagios.org/)) and alerts can be generated.
* Mule includes a RESTful interface which can be used to generate graphs and to monitor thresholds using tools such as [Nagios](http://www.nagios.org/).

# Definitions

* retention pair: `step:period`, for example, `1h:30d`
* metric - a (logical) name *without* any retention data, for example, `beer.stout.irish`
* event - a triple `name value timestamp`, input to the database
* sequence - list of slots, identified by a triple `<metric,step,period>`. These are managed by Mule.
* name - a triple `metric;step:period`, for example, `beer.stout;1h:30d`.
* factory - names (that is, a triple) that are used for the configuration.

# Usage

## Configuration format

The configuration uses one line per metric in the following format:

    <metric> <list-of-retention-pairs>

For example:

    beer.stout 60s:12h 1h:30d


A line can include multiple retention pairs and the same pattern can appear in multiple lines.

### Metric
A *metric* is defined as follows:

* It can be any Lua string.
* Every dot delimited prefix is also a metric, that is, `beer.stout.irish.dublin`, generates the following:
    * `beer`
    * `beer.stout`
    * `beer.stout.irish`
    * `beer.stout.irish.dublin`
* The most specific match for every metric is used to create the retention sequences for it.

#### Retention units
The following lists the retention units:

* `s` - sec
* `m` - min
* `h` - hour
* `d` - day
* `w` - week
* `m` - month (30 days)
* `y` - year (365 days)


#### Input Format
Each input line should be in the following format:

An *event* (the type param is optional)
    <metric> <value> <timestamp> [<type>]

or a *command*

    .<command> ...

##### Event

    beer.stout.irish 20 74857843
This means that 20 orders of `beer.stout.irish` were recorded at the given timestamp, measured in seconds (also known as Unix time). The value (20 in this example) is added to the count of the metric for this particular bucket, derived from the timestamp and the *step* value.

Two more metric types are supported:

* Gauge - if an equal sign `=` precedes the value, then the value replaces the number rather than adding to it.
* High water mark - if `^` precedes the value, the maximal value is used.

For example:

    beer.stout.irish =32 74858041

##### Command
The following command runs garbage collection for any metric with the prefix `beer.stout` that wasn't updated after the provided timestamp.

    .gc beer.stout 7489826


### Commands


#### Command line interface

The following commands can be issue via the command line or in an input file. Recall that they should be preceded by a `.` (dot).
* `graph <metric> [<timestamp>]` - Retrieve all the sequences for which the given parameter is a prefix. `<metric>` can be an exact sequence name. `<timestamp>` can be used to limit the output to a range. `<timestamp>` can be a comma-separated array of timestamps. Additionally, `l` (latest) and `n` (now) can be used as well as simple arithmetic operations. For example, `<timestamp>` can be `l-10..l,n,n-100..l+50`.
* `key <metric>` - Retrieve all the metrics for which the given parameter is a prefix. `<metric>` can be an exact sequence name.
* `latest <metric-or-name>` - Retrieves the latest updated slot.
* `slot <metric-or-name> <timestamp>` - Retrieves the slots specified by the timestamp(s).
* `gc <metric> <timestamp> [<force>]` - Erase all metrics that weren't updated since the timestamp. You must pass `true` for `<force>` to modify the database.
* `reset <metric>` - Clear all slots in the metric.


### REST API

#### Graphs

##### Retrieve Graph Data
Use a GET request to retrieve graph data, in the following format:

    http://muleserver/graph/<metric-or-name>?<timestamps>|<level>|<alerts>

* `<metric-or-name>` is a `metric` or a `name`, that is, it includes retention data. If `metric` is used, all the graphs for the metric will be returned, that is, the graphs for all the names for which the metric is a prefix.
* Available query string parameters:
  * `timestamps` - The graph data is restricted to the given timestamps. Timestamps can be a comma-separated list of seconds or simple arithmetic expressions using the predefined variables `now` (or `n`) and `latest` (or `l`), for example, `l-10s`, `now-20d`.
  * `alerts` - If `alerts` is set to true, the alerts status is added to the names for which alerts are defined.
  * `level` - The `level` parameter is optional and sets the number of sub key levels to retrieve. Each dot represents one level. The default level is 1. If no retention pair is provided, all the sub keys and their retention pairs are returned. If a retention pair is provided, only the sub keys with the same retention pairs are returned.
  * `filter` - The `filter` parameter can be set to `now` or `latest`. If it is set to `now`, only the results in the time period of `now-period`..`now` are returned. Similarly, `latest` filters according to the latest time at which the sequence was updated.

The following shows an output example where each triple is `<value,hits,timestamp>`

```json
mule_graph({
  "version": 3,
  "data": {
    "wine.pinotage.south_africa;1d:3y": [[4,3,1293753600]]
    "wine.pinotage;1d:3y": [[7,5,1293753600]],
    "wine.pinotage;1h:30d": [[2,1,1293832800],[5,4,1293836400]],
    "wine.pinotage;5m:2d": [[2,1,1293836100],[2,1,1293836400],[3,1,1293837000]],
    "alerts": {"wine.pinotage;1h:30d": [34,100,800,900,86400,172800,0,"stale"]}
    }
})
```

You can use multiple metrics or names by separating them with `/`, for example:

    http://muleserver/graph/<metric>


##### Update Graph
To update graph data, use a POST request to:

    http://muleserver/graph

or (for compatibility with older versions)

    http://muleserver/update

The contents of the file are lines in the format described in the [Input Format](#input-format) section:

    <metric> <value> <timestamp>

##### Reset Graph Data
Use a DELETE request to erase a graph, or to set its data to 0. You can use only one of the following parameters in each request.

* `force` - Pass `force=true` to remove the graph.
* `timestamp` - All the entries before and including the timestamp are set to 0. **Note**: The entries are not deleted.

Optional parameters:
* `level` - The depth of the sub keys to reset. The default value is 0.


#### Key
The metrics and names create a hierarchy that can be retrieved by sending a GET request to:

    http://muleserver/key/<metric>?<level>

* `metric` - Returns all the names for which `metric` is a prefix.
* `level` - The `level` parameter is optional and sets the number of sub key levels to retrieve. Each dot represents one level. The default level is 1. If no retention pair is provided, all the sub keys and their retention pairs are returned. If a retention pair is provided, only the sub keys with the same retention pairs are returned.

Example output: (`level=1`)

```json
mule_keys({
  "version": 3,
  "data": {
    "beer.ale;1d:3y": { "children": true },
    "beer.ale.pale;1h:30d": { },
    "beer.ale.pale;1d:3y": { },
    "beer.ale.pale;5m:2d": { },
    "beer.ale;1h:30d": { "children": true },
    "beer.ale;5m:2d": { "children": true }
  }
})
```

You can use multiple metrics or names by separating them with `/`, for example:

    http://muleserver/key/<metric_1>/<metric_2>/.../<metric_n>

#### Access to Specific Slots
The data for specific slots can be retrieved by sending a GET request to:

    http://muleserver/slot/<metric-or-name>?<timestamps>

The timestamps (as described in the [Graphs](#graphs) section) are not optional. Multiple values can be passed as a list.

Retrieving only the latest updated slot is supported using the following:

    http://muleserver/latest/<metric-or-name>

You can use use multiple metrics in both of these requests if you separate the metrics with `/`.

#### Alerts

##### Checking Alerts
Alerts are designed to be compatible with [Nagios](http://www.nagios.org/).

When an alert is defined, you can check its state using a GET request:

     http://muleserver/alert/<name>

If you do not provide a `name`, all the alerts are retrieved. The return value is:

```json
{
  "version": 3,
  "data": {
    "<name>": [<critical_low>,<warning_low>,<warning_high>,<critical_high>,<period>,<stale>,<value>,<state>,<check_timestamp>,<msg>]
  }
  "anomalies": {
    "<name>": [<timestamp_1>,...,<timestamp_n>]
  }
}
```
The parameters are defined as follows:

* `critical_low, warning_low, warning_high, critical_high` - The threshold value of the alerts.
* `period` - The alert period.
* `stale` - If the graph is not updated during a certain time period (in seconds), the state changes to `stale`. **Note**: Updating the graph with a 0 value is considered an update.
* `value` - The graph's value at the time of the check.
* `state` - The state of the alert: `NORMAL, CRITICAL_LOW, WARNING_LOW, WARNING_HIGH, CRITICAL_HIGH, stale`
* `check_timestamp` - The time of the check.
* `msg` - An optional text message.

If there are detected anomalies in the data, they will be returned as a separate table. Each entry would be a graph name and the value would be an array of timestamps at which anomalies were detected. See the //Anomaly Detection in Time Series// section for a review of the anomaly detection code.


##### Defining Alerts
Defining an alert is done by issuing a PUT request to

    http://muleserver/alert/

with the request body being

    critical_low=<critical_low>&warning_low=<warning_low>&warning_high=<warning_high>&critical_high=<critical_high>&period=<period>&stale=<stale>

* `critical_low, warning_low, warning_high, critical_high` - The threshold value of the alerts.
* `period` - The alert period. It needn't be necessarily the same as the graph step period.
* `stale` - If the graph is not updated during a certain time period (in seconds), the state changes to `stale`. **Note**: Updating the graph with a 0 value is considered an update.


#### Anomaly Detection in Time Series
This code implement anomaly detection in time series representing aggregated counting of events over days, hours or minutes.

The algorithms are based on Model based Fault Detection and Isolation (FDI) and  Adaptive filtering, under Signal based detection technology. The signal model is based on a shifted log normal distribution (Week/Daily seasonality). The estimation of  the signal model is done recursively, with forgetting factors, while detecting changes. Estimation is selectively restarted after a change is done during an adaptive burn-in period. Detecting changes is done with Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) test. Statistical test is used to detect both steady changes and outliers (spikes).

The working assumption is that we are interested in 3 types of changes: abrupt (step) incipient (spike) and intermittent (drifting change). Yet this method to classify change types is not the only used way.

Although the API accepts an entire graph, the internal algorithm is online i.e. it gets sample after sample in a chronological order and produces alert/no-alert output on each new time point without a delay. The alert is produced as a response to a change in the signal, and removed when the algorithm decides that the signal is back to its previous behavior, or alternatively, when it decides that a new behavior became steady.

General algorithmic note: In the time series experimented the changes were usually either short temporal changes (spikes) or steep step functions. In order to adjust quickly to spikes, after a change had been detected, the old model was kept for a duration smaller or equal to some fallback threshold. During this fallback duration, if a measurement suitable to the old model is observed, the algorithm falls back to the old model. In order to adjust quickly to steep step functions, the last detected abnormal value is kept. If subsequent values are evaluated as normal under the hypotheses this value is a correct model, for a stability period defined by another constant threshold, then we update the model according to this hypotheses. Furthermore, all time the hypothesized model fits, no alerts are produced, even if the new model was not yet accepted. The above mechanisms lead to a fast adjustment to the common spike and steep step changes. The price is slower adjustment to rare types of changes. For example, during a period of constantly instability, the algorithm alarm may blink rather than constantly alarm.

##### Triggering the Anomaly Detection Algorithm
In order to run the anomaly detection code, a GET request should be issued
    http://muleserver/fdi/<metric-or-name>?<level>

The `<metric-or-name>` and `<level>` params are identical to those used by the `/graph` call.


#### Stop
You can stop the http daemon with the following command. This is not intended to be secure and provides basic protection from accidental termination.

    http://muleserver/stop?token=<stop_password>

#### Backup
You can create a backup of the database with the following command. This command returns the path of the backup database.

    http://muleserver/backup


#### Configuration
To update Mule's configuration POST a configuration file to:

    http://muleserver/config
For example:

    curl -vd @<(echo "wine. 1d:3y") http://muleserver/config

To read (export) the configuration use GET:

    http://muleserver/config

#### Key-value store
Mule provides a simple interface for storing arbitrary values. Using the relevant HTTP verbs:
* To retrieve the value associated with a key use a GET request to `http://muleserver/kvs/<key>`
* To set (or update) the value associated with a key use a PUT request to `http://muleserver/kvs/<key>` where the body is the value
* To remove a key and its value use a DELETE request to `http://muleserver/kvs/<key>`.

### Processing Speed
During testing on a c3.2xlarge AWS instance with SSD in RAID 0, Mule peaked at approximately 200 files per second, with an average file size of 3k, and an average number of lines of 42. The Nginx based frontend can handle writes of approximately 300 files per second.

## Installation

### The short version
1. install all the dependencies (rocks and lightningmdb)
1. create the db `lua mule.lua -r -d <db-path> -c <configuration-file>`
1. run Mule `lua mule.lua -d <db-path> -t localhost:3012 -x stopme`


### Lua and luarocks

* Install >=Lua 5.1 (caveat - Lua 5.3 was only lightly tested) using your standard package manager. You can also install Lua from the [Lua download page](http://www.lua.org/download.html).
* Install luarocks using the package manager or from the [luarocks download page](http://luarocks.org/en/Download).
* Install additional rocks - copas, lpack, luaposix, StackTracePlus (optional)

### Lightning Memory-Mapped Database (LMDB)
First of all, LMDB needs to be installed.
<pre>
git clone https://github.com/LMDB/lmdb # This will create a directory ./mdb/libraries/liblmdb
cd ./lmdb/libraries/liblmdb
make
sudo make install
</pre>
Then install the ```lightningmdb```  rock
<pre>
sudo luarocks install lightningmdb
</pre>

### Deployment model

#### DB creation
The first step is to create a new DB for mule

    lua mule.lua -r -d <db-path> -c <configuration-file>

Mule automatically decides which DB to create by inspecting the `db-path` suffix:
- `_mdb` - lightningmdb
- `_cdb` - column db (a pure lua DB implementation)

Providing the configuration file is optional, as mule can be configured while running also (as described above, using the `config` call).

#### Internal HTTP daemon
Mule ships with a simple HTTP daemon and supports:

* A REST/JSONP interface
* (naive) static files serving

Mule is assumed to be an internal application, therefore, no attempt was made to make the daemon full featured. It is recommended to place an industry level HTTP server/proxy in front of it.

To run Mule as an HTTP daemon run the following command:

    lua mule.lua -d <db-path> -t <bind-address>:<port> [-x <stop-password>] [-l <log-path>] [-R <static-files-root-path>]

For example,

    lua mule.lua -d mule_cdb -t localhost:3012 -x stopme

#### (through) Nginx
The recommended mule setup, is proxying the traffic through Nginx. In this setup, mule runs as a backend HTTP server (as explained above) but the traffic is proxied through Nginx. This setup enables:
- Serving static files (the user interface, see below) directly via Nginx
- Async processing of input files - a Lua script, running inside Nginx, saves the submitted input into a local directory (which serves as a queue). Mule then periodically scans the directory, and processes the files. This mode of operation adds to the robustness of the system, as Mule can be restarted and updated without losing data.
- Queries are proxied through Ngins directly to mule.


Sample Nginx configuration is provided in `Nginx.mule.conf.sample`. In this sample the URL routes are:
- For accessing the mule API, including file submission `http://muleserver/mule/api/`.
- For accessing the *muleview* application `http://muleserver/mule/`.
- For accessing the *scent* application `http://muleserver/scent/`.


### User interface

Two different web applications are provided with Mule, *muelview* provides a rich interface, where as *scent* is oriented towards dashboard view. Both are best used through a webserver, like Nginx (for which sample configuration is provided) but as Mule has a simple webserver implementation can be used in standalone mode as well.

#### Scent

Scent provides a simple UI for viewing Mule metrics. It supports customizable dashboards, favourites and alerts views.

Priot to using Scent, there is a need to create a configuration file, based on the sample in `scent/config.js.sample`. It can be simply copied, though special attention should be given to the `server` attribute which determines the path to use for API calls.

To use Mule+scent in standalone mode, use

   lua mule.lua -d db/my_great_db_cdb -t myserver:80 -R scent/

#### Muleview

Mule ships with a simple [Ext JS](http://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/)-based client web-application written in [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) called "Muleview".
Muleview can display graphs of all Mule's current data.

##### Requirements
Muleview requires [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) for compilation and [Sencha Cmd](http://www.sencha.com/products/sencha-cmd/download) for creating a production-ready build, that is, a single-file minified version of the entire framework and source (all_classes.js) and all the necessary static resources.

##### Build
To build a production-ready folder:

1. Install [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/#installation) and make sure the `coffee` command is available.
1. Install [Sencha Cmd](http://www.sencha.com/products/sencha-cmd/download). This requires additional 3rd party components such as Java and Compass.
1. Change directory to the muleview directory (`cd muleview`) and run `sencha app build`.
1. The output should be generated under `muleview/build/Muleview/production`.

##### Built-in Serving with Mule
You can use Mule as a web-server for Muleview. To use Mule as a web-server, run Mule with the static files root path parameter (`-R muleview/build/Muleview/production`).

To use Mule+muleview in standalone mode, use

    lua mule.lua -d db/my_great_db_cdb -t myserver:80 -R muleview/build/Muleview/production

It is recommended to run Mule and Muleview on different servers. If they are on different servers, before you compile and build Muleview, you must enter Mule's URL in `muleview/coffee/app/Settings.coffee`.

### Development environment

#### Vagrant Box
Mule ships with a [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com) server for development.
To set up the server:

1. Install vagrant
1. `cd vagrant`
1. `vagrant up`
1. `vagrant ssh`
1. `/vagrant/setup.sh`
This sets up a server with all the relevant development dependencies and an Nginx server that is accessible from the your host at localhost:3000/mule/

#### Docker
Mule ships with a couple of Docker files used to automate the unit tests across multiple Lua versions. Additionally a Docker file with a mule+Nginx setup is provided.
